= Reference Attachments

When a list item is a reference to an attachment, the link is created using the link macro (`+link:{attachmentsdir}/filename.ext[link text]+`).

== Attachment links

An attachment is a resource stored in an xref:ROOT:attachments-directory.adoc[_attachments_ directory].
To xref:asciidoc:link-attachment.adoc[insert a link to an attachment], use the AsciiDoc link macro (`+link:[]+`).
