= Add Links to External Sites

A navigation list can contain links to external websites.
External links are links to websites or materials that aren't built as part of your site's Antora pipeline.
That is, the target doesn't belong to a component version.

== External links

Links to external websites and materials are created using the xref:asciidoc:external-urls.adoc#url-syntax[AsciiDoc URL syntax].
AsciiDoc's URL syntax requires that the target have a valid URI scheme (e.g., `https://`) and address.

** https://external-website.com[Link text]
** https://another-external-website.com

If you don't add a set of square brackets (`+[]+`) directly onto the end of the URL and insert link text, the raw URL will be displayed in the component version page menu when the site is generated.
