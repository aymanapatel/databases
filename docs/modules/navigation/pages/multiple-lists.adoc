= Create a Navigation File with Multiple Lists

== Structuring multiple lists

A navigation file can contain more than one xref:asciidoc:ordered-and-unordered-lists.adoc#unordered[unordered AsciiDoc lists].
When a navigation file contains multiple lists:

* each list must start with a list title, and
* each list must be separated by at least one blank line.

[source]
----
.List title <1>
* List item
<2>
.Second list title <3>
* List item <4>
----
<1> Required list title.
A list title is preceded by a dot (`.`).
There must be *no spaces* between the `.` and the content of the title.
<2> Required blank line between lists.
<3> Required list title.
<4> List item.

When converted to HTML, the list titles become top-level items and all of their list items are nested under them in cascading order.
The blank line between the lists is not present in the published menu.

Each navigation list is made up of list items.

.Navigation file with multiple lists
[source]
----
.List title <1>
* List item <2>
* List item <3>
** Nested item <4>

.List title <5>
* List item
** Nested item

.List title
* List item
----
<1> A list title becomes the top-level list item of a list.
<2> A list item preceded by an unordered AsciiDoc list marker (`+*+`).
<3> Each list item must be entered on its own line.
<4> Enter a blank space between the last asterisk of a marker and the content of your list item.
<5> A list title, indicating the start of another navigation list.

Each list item is preceded by a marker.
An unordered AsciiDoc list's marker can range from one asterisk (`+*+`) to five asterisks (`+*****+`).

== Create a navigation file with two lists

Let's create a navigation file that contains two navigation lists for the pages in a module.
The most common items in a navigation list are xrefs to pages xref:organize-files.adoc[that belong to the same module as the navigation file].
The exercise below assumes that the navigation file will belong to the same component version and module as the pages it is referencing.
That means the page IDs won't need to specify version, component, or module coordinates.

. Open a new file in the text editor or IDE of your choice.
. On the first line, type a dot (`.`), directly followed by an xref macro prefix and the page ID of the target page.
+
[source]
----
.xref:get-started.adoc
----

. At the end of the page ID, complete the macro with a set of square brackets (`+[]+`).
Press kbd:[Enter] to go to the next line.
+
--
[source]
----
.xref:get-started.adoc[]
----

Since there isn't any link text specified inside the square brackets, Antora will use the value of the target page's xref:xrefs-and-link-text.adoc#default-link-text[default link text] when it generates the site.
--

. Let's add a list item.
Type an asterisk (`+*+`), followed by a blank space, and then an xref.
This time, enter link text inside the set of square brackets (`+[]+`).
Press kbd:[Enter]
+
--
[source]
----
.xref:get-started.adoc[]
* xref:install.adoc[Installation Setup and Steps]
----

The link text, _Installation Setup and Steps_, will be displayed in the component version page menu.
--

. Let's start a new list.
Press kbd:[Enter] to insert a blank like between the lists.
On a new line, type a dot (`.`), directly followed by regular text.
This list title won't reference a page.
+
[source]
----
.xref:get-started.adoc[]
* xref:install.adoc[Installation Setup and Steps]

.CLI Commands and Options
----

. On the next line, type an asterisk (`+*+`), a blank space, and then an xref macro.
This item is a cross reference that will use the target page's default link text.
+
[source]
----
.xref:get-started.adoc[]
* xref:install.adoc[Installation Setup and Steps]

.CLI Commands and Options
* xref:commands.adoc[]
----

. Finally, nest a list item under the previous item.
Type two asterisks (`+**+`), followed by a blank space, and then an xref.
+
[source]
----
.xref:get-started.adoc[]
* xref:install.adoc[Installation Setup and Steps]

.CLI Commands and Options
* xref:commands.adoc[]
** xref:commands-in-action.adoc[]
----

. Save the file as [.path]_nav.adoc_ in the xref:ROOT:module-directories.adoc#module-dir[module directory] that contains the page source files referenced in the list.
The navigation file should be located at the same hierarchy level as the [.path]_pages_ directory.
*Don't save it in the [.path]_pages_ folder!*
+
--
----
ðŸ“‚ modules
  ðŸ“‚ a-module
    ðŸ“‚ pages
    ðŸ“„ nav.adoc
----

You can also save the file with the filename of your choice, as long as the extension is _.adoc_.
--

You've now create a navigation file for a module!
Make sure you xref:register-navigation-files.adoc[register it in _antora.yml_] so it becomes part of the component version page menu.
