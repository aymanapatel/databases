== Foundations of Data Systems


=== Reliable, Scalable and Maitainable Applications 

=== Data Models nd Query Language

=== Storage and Retrieval

=== Encoding and Evolution


== Distributed Data


=== Shared-Disk s Shared-Nothing Architecture


1. Shared Nothing keeps *networking* as connecting layer.

    - Requires a lot of caution from application developer

2. Shared Disk keeps *disk as connecting layer.

=== Replication vs Partitioning 

=== Replication


=== Partitioning

=== Transactions


=== Trouble with Distributed Systems

==== Partial Failures


In Distributed Computing, we have **partial failures** -> **non-deterministic failure** 

NOTE: Large datacenter networks are often based on IP and Ethernet, arranged in Clos topologies to provide high bisection bandwidth [9]. Supercomputers often use specialized network topologies, such as multi-dimensional meshes and toruses [10], which yield better performance for HPC workloads with known communication patterns.

WARNING: If we want to make distributed systems work, we must accept the possibility of partial failure and build fault-tolerance mechanisms into the software.

It may seem like a system can only be as reliable as its least reliable component (its weakest link). This is not the case:

1. Error-correcting Code keep in mind lost bits while transmission.
2. TCP takes into account for re-transmission and duplicate packet removal in the protocol itself.




=== Consistency and Consensus

== Derived Data


=== Batch Processing

=== Stream Processing

=== Future of Data Systems
