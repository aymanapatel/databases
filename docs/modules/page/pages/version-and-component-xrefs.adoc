= Xref Pages in Other Components and Versions

Sometimes you'll need to create cross references between pages that belong to different docs components.
In these cases, you'll often construct a fully qualified page ID.
You can also create xrefs between pages that belong to different versions of the same component.

[#xref-page-in-different-docs-component]
== Xref pages from other docs components

When the xref:page-id.adoc#current-page[current] and xref:page-id.adoc#target-page[target] pages belong to different docs components, you must, at a minimum, specify the target xref:page-id.adoc#id-coordinates[component, module, and page coordinates].
You'll almost always specify the target version coordinate, too.

.current-page.adoc

xref:version@component:module:target-page-filename.adoc[link text]

For context, let's use the pages that belong to the component versions `colorado 5.2` and `wyoming 1.0` as the basis for the examples on this section.
Their source files are stored in the xref:ROOT:standard-directories.adoc[standard directory trees] listed in <<ex-co-and-wy>>.

<<ex-across-components>> shows an xref in the page [.path]_index.adoc_ (current page) that links to the [.path]_elevation.adoc_ page (target page).
[.path]_index.adoc_ belongs to version `5.2` of the component `colorado`.
[.path]_elevation.adoc_ belongs to version `1.0` of the component `wyoming`.

[#ex-across-components]
.index.adoc (current page)

----
See xref:1.0@wyoming:sierra-madre:elevation.adoc[How are peaks measured]?
----

When the xref in <<ex-across-components>> is converted, it will become a link to the published site page at [.path]_\https://base-url.com/wyoming/1.0/sierra-madre/elevation.html_.

In <<ex-across-components-short-root>>, the page [.path]_ranges.adoc_ is referenced from the page [.path]_elevation.adoc_ (current page).
The target page, [.path]_ranges.adoc_, belongs to the `ROOT` module of the `colorado` component.

[#ex-across-components-short-root]
.elevation.adoc (current page)

----
xref:5.2@colorado::ranges.adoc[List of ranges by height]
----

Notice in <<ex-across-components-short-root>> that the module name `ROOT` seems to be missing from the page ID.
When a component coordinate is specified in a page ID, and the target page belongs to the `ROOT` module, the module coordinate `ROOT` doesn't have to be explicitly specified.
But you must still enter the colon `:` that would follow the module coordinate.
You can see this `:` directly before the page coordinate `ranges.adoc`.
This shorthand only works when a component coordinate is specified and the target module is `ROOT`.
In all other cases where the target module coordinate is required, the name of the module must be specified.

[#xref-latest-version-of-component-version-page]
=== Xref the latest version of a page

TIP: This behavior only applies when the target and current pages belong to different docs components!

If a version isn't specified in the target page ID, *and the target and current pages belong to a different docs components*, Antora will use the xref:ROOT:how-component-versions-are-sorted.adoc#latest-version[latest version] of the target component to complete the page ID.

Using the component versions previously described in <<ex-co-and-wy>>, let's create an xref in the page [.path]_index.adoc_ (current page) that links to the [.path]_elevation.adoc_ page (target page).
The xref is shown below in <<ex-across-components-latest>>.
[.path]_index.adoc_ belongs to version `5.2` of the component `colorado`.
[.path]_elevation.adoc_ belongs to version `1.0` of the component `wyoming`.
Notice that the target page's version coordinate isn't specified.

[#ex-across-components-latest]
.index.adoc (current page)
[source]
----
See xref:wyoming:sierra-madre:elevation.adoc[How are peaks measured]?
----

Since there isn't a version coordinate in <<ex-across-components-latest>>, Antora will automatically complete the page ID at runtime using the latest version -- `1.0` -- of the `wyoming` component.
When you release a newer version of `wyoming`, such as version `1.5`, and add it to your site, the xref in <<ex-across-components-latest>> will automatically link to the [.path]_elevation.adoc_ page in version `1.5` of `wyoming`.

WARNING: This behavior of linking to the latest version only applies when the version coordinate is unspecified and the target and current pages belong to different components.
If you don't specify a version and a component in the page ID, Antora assumes the target page's version and component are the same as the current page's version and component coordinates.

[#xref-page-in-different-version]
== Xref pages from other versions

When the current and target pages belong to the same docs component, but the target page belongs to a different version of that component, you'll specify the target version, module (if it's different), and page coordinates.

xref:version@module:target-page-filename.adoc[link text]

If the target and current pages belong to the same module, too, then you only need to specify the target version and page coordinates.

For context, let's use the pages that belong to the component versions `colorado 5.2` and `colorado 6.0` as the basis for the example in this section.
Their source files are stored in the xref:ROOT:standard-directories.adoc[standard directory trees] listed in <<ex-co-versions>>.

Notice that the `colorado 5.2` component version has a [.path]_tour.adoc_ page that belongs to the `get-started` module.
However, `colorado 6.0` has no such module or page.

Let's reference the page [.path]_tour.adoc_ (target page), which belongs to `colorado 5.2`, from the page [.path]_cochetopa-pass.adoc_ (current page), which belongs to the `colorado 6.0` component version.
In <<ex-across-versions>>, the xref specifies the target page's version, module, and page coordinates.

When the xref in <<ex-across-versions>> is converted by Antora, it will become a link to the published site page at [.path]_\https://base-url.com/colorado/5.2/get-started/tour.html_.
