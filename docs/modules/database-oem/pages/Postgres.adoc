== Table Bloat

In Postgres,  when you do an `UPDATE` or `DELETE`, the row isn't actually physically deleted. 
For a `DELETE`, it simply marks the row as unavailable for future transactions, and for `UPDATE`, under the hood it's a combined `INSERT` then `DELETE`, where the previous version of the row is marked unavailable.

> aka Ghost Record in MSSQL

NOTE: Check if Oracle has this issue. If not, why?
