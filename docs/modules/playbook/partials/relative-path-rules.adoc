A relative path is expanded to an absolute path using the following rules:

* If the first path segment is a tilde (`~`), the remaining path is resolved relative to the user's home directory.
* If the first path segment is a dot (`.`), the remaining path is resolved relative to the location of the playbook file.
* If the first path segment is a tilde directly followed by a plus sign (`~+`), or does not begin with an aforementioned prefix, the remaining path is resolved relative to the current working directory.
