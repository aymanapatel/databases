= Content Snippets and Partials

Partials contain regular content that's typically written and structured so that it can be inserted into more than one page.
They're stored in a xref:ROOT:partials-directory.adoc[_partials_ directory] and can be referenced by any page or partial, regardless of the component version they belong to.

== Reusable, single source content

Partials are good for storing snippets of content, such as common descriptions, project introductions, terminology, frequent admonitions, and reference tables, that you reuse in one or more pages throughout your site.
When you change the content in a partial, those changes will disseminate to all of the pages where you embedded that partial with an xref:include-a-partial.adoc[AsciiDoc include directive].
Specific regions or lines from a partial can also be inserted in a page using the include directive's `tag`, `tags`, or `lines` attributes.
