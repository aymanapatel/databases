= Choose a Start Page

Each component version needs a start page.
This page can either be the default start page or a page identified by the component version descriptor.
Visitors land on a component version's start page when they click on its entry in the xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-dropdown[component version selector] and when they click on its name at the xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-menu[top of the page menu].

The start page for a component version is separate from the start page for a site.
The start page for a site is where the visitor is directed when they go to the site's main URL.
To configure your site's start page, see xref:playbook:site-start-page.adoc[].

== Default start page

By default, Antora looks for a xref:page:start-page.adoc[page named _index.adoc_] in the ROOT module of a component version and uses it as the component version's start page (e.g., _\https://site-url.org/component-name/version/index.html_).
If Antora doesn't find this page, visitors are directed to a 404 page every time they click on the component version from the xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-dropdown[component version selector] or xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-menu[page menu].

Antora won't look for [.path]_index.adoc_ in the ROOT module when the <<start-page-key,start_page key>> is set in a component version's [.path]_antora.yml_.
Instead, the page assigned to `start_page` will be used as the component version's start page.

[#start-page-key]
== start_page key

The `start_page` key must be set in [.path]_antora.yml_ when:

. a component version doesn't have a page named [.path]_index.adoc_ in its ROOT module, or
. when Antora should use an alternate page (that is, not [.path]_index.adoc_, even if it exists) as the component version's start page.

The `start_page` key accepts a xref:page:page-id.adoc[page ID] that references a page that *belongs to the component version the [.path]_antora.yml_ file describes*.
The page ID must specify a module coordinate.

In <<ex-start>>, the component version's start page, `overview.adoc`, is located in the module `get-started`.
