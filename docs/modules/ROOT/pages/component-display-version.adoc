= Customize the Display Version

The `display_version` key is strictly used for presentation purposes in the reference UI when a version identifier contains uppercase letters, symbols, or blank spaces.
It doesn't affect page and resource IDs, the version segment in the page URL, or xref:how-component-versions-are-sorted.adoc[how component versions are sorted].

[#display-version-key]
== display_version key

The `display_version` key is optional.
It's set in a component version's [.path]_antora.yml_ file and used by the reference UI where ever the version is displayed, including the xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-dropdown[component version selector] and xref:navigation:index.adoc#page-dropdown[page version selector].

If `display_version` isn't set, the reference UI falls back to xref:component-name-and-version.adoc#version-key[the version key].
Unlike `version`, the value of `display_version` can contain empty spaces, uppercase letters, and most characters (e.g., `3.0 Beta`, `RED WREN!`, `rawhide`).

.antora.yml
[source,yaml]
----
name: colorado
title: Colorado âˆ†
version: '5.6'
display_version: '5.6 EOL' # <1>
----
<1> If the value starts with a number, enclose it in a set of single quote marks (`'`).

The `display_version` key should be used when a version contains spaces or characters that break Antora's page and resource IDs, prevent portability between web servers, and aren't recommended in URLs.
It's useful when the component version is a xref:component-prerelease.adoc[prerelease], xref:component-with-no-version.adoc[unversioned], or archived because the value of `display_version` doesn't affect page URLs, page IDs, and resource IDs.

TIP: The xref:component-prerelease.adoc[prerelease key] provides additional UI routing, sorting, and presentation capabilities.
While the value of the `display_version` key is shown in the UI when both keys are set, the computed prerelease version generated from a xref:component-prerelease.adoc#identifier[prerelease identifier] is used for sorting and routing.

[#assign-display-version]
== Assign a display_version to a component version

Let's expand on the [.path]_antora.yml_ example where you previously learned xref:component-name-and-version.adoc#assign-name-and-version[how to assign a component name and version].
The _Silver Leaf_ project team wants the version code name in addition to its version number to be displayed in the UI.
Since `version` can't contain blank spaces, let's set `display_version` in the component version's [.path]_antora.yml_ file.

. Open the component version's [.path]_antora.yml_ file in the text editor or IDE of your choice.
+
.antora.yml for the component version silver-leaf 7.1
[source,yaml]
----
name: silver-leaf
title: Silver Leaf
version: '7.1'
----

. On a blank line, type `display_version`, directly followed by a colon (`:`).
. Insert a blank space after the colon, and then type the value you want to assign to `display_version`.
Since the value begins with a number, enclose it in a set of single quote marks (`'`).
+
[source,yaml]
----
name: silver-leaf
title: Silver Leaf
version: '7.1'
display_version: '7.1 Spiny'
----

. Save the file.

Now, the UI will display _7.1 Spiny_ in the component version selector and page version selector.
