= Attachments Directory and Files

[#attachments-dir]
== Attachments family directory

A module directory can contain an xref:family-directories.adoc[optional family directory] named [.path]_attachments_.

<2> An attachment source file

Antora applies preset behavior to the source files stored in an [.path]_attachments_ directory when it generates a site.

[#attachments]
== Attachments

An [.term]*attachment* is a resource, such as the ZIP archive of a sample project, that a site visitor can download via a link.
The source files for attachments are stored in an [.path]_attachments_ directory.
A link to an attachment is created in a page or partial using the xref:asciidoc:link-attachment.adoc[AsciiDoc link macro].
Currently, you can't xref:page:resource-id.adoc#reference-syntax-id-requirements[reference an attachment] using an Antora resource ID.

=== Binaries and other large files

If your content includes large attachment files, such as sample project binaries, libraries, or PDFs, we don't recommend storing them in a regular git repository.
Instead, host them in a binary repository such as Bintray or S3, or use git LFS (Large File Storage).
