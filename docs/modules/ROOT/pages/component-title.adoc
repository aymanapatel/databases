= Customize the Title

The `title` key is used for xref:how-component-versions-are-sorted.adoc[sorting the versions by name] and for display purposes in the reference UI when a component name contains uppercase letters, symbols, or blank spaces.
It doesn't affect page and resource IDs or the component name segment in the page URL.

[#title-key]
== title key

The `title` key is optional.
It's set in a component version's [.path]_antora.yml_ file and used by the reference UI where ever the component's name is displayed, including the xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-menu[component version page menu], xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-dropdown[component version selector], and first breadcrumb position on a component version's pages.

If `title` isn't set, the reference UI uses the xref:component-name-and-version.adoc#name-key[value of name] instead.
Unlike `name`, the value of `title` can contain empty spaces, uppercase letters, and a broader range of characters (e.g., `SUSE Manager`, `APIkit`).

.antora.yml
[source,yaml]
----
name: colorado
title: Colorado âˆ†
version: '5.6'
----

This key is useful when a project's name contains spaces or characters that break Antora's page and resource IDs, prevent portability between web servers, or aren't recommended in URLs.
Also, if the name of your project changes, you can change the value of the `title` key but not have to update page and resource IDs or redirect URLs.

[#assign-title]
== Assign a title to a component version

Let's expand on the [.path]_antora.yml_ example where you previously learned xref:component-name-and-version.adoc#assign-name-and-version[how to assign a component name and version].
The project's official name is _Silver Leaf_, and the team wants this name to be displayed in the UI.
Since `name` can't contain blank spaces, let's set `title` in the component version's [.path]_antora.yml_ file.

. Open the component version's [.path]_antora.yml_ file in the text editor or IDE of your choice.
+
.antora.yml for the component version silver-leaf 7.1
[source,yaml]
----
name: silver-leaf
version: '7.1'
----

. On a blank line, type `title`, directly followed by a colon (`:`).
. Insert a blank space after the colon, and then type the value you want to assign to `title`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
name: silver-leaf
title: Silver Leaf
version: '7.1'
----

. Save the file.

Now, the UI will display _Silver Leaf_ in the component version page menu, component version selector, and page breadcrumbs.
