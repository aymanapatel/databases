Antora applies preset behavior to the source files stored in an [.path]_images_ directory when it generates a site.

[#images]
== Images

xref:page:images.adoc[Images] are resources, such as photographs, diagrams, and screenshots.
The source files for images are stored in an [.path]_images_ family directory.
Antora supports the PNG, JPG, SVG, and GIF (static and animated) image file formats.

An image can be embedded into any page or partial, regardless of the module or component version it belongs to, using its xref:page:resource-id.adoc[resource ID] and an AsciiDoc xref:page:block-images.adoc[block image macro] or xref:page:inline-images.adoc[inline image macro].
If an image isn't referenced in an AsciiDoc image macro, its content won't be published to a site.
