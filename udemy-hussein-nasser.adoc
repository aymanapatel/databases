== ACID


=== Transaction


- Collection of queries
- A Unit of Work
- Account  Deposit (SELECT, UPDATE, UPDATE)
    1. `SELECT balance FROM Account WHERE ID=1`
    2. Check if Balance deposited is available
    3. `UPDATE Account SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE ID=1`
    4. `UPDATE Account SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE ID=2`
    5. COMMIT


=== Atomicity

> All queries must succeed. If fail, then rollback everything. `
