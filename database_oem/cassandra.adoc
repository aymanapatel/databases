== Chapter 01: Why not RDBMS?

=== Scalability issues in relational DBs

1. Throw new Hardware aka Vertical scaling

2. Once box is fullm you add additional box in DB cluster. ow issue of data replication and consistency arises.

3. Upgrade config of DBMS for optimizing DB data in Filesystem. This is undesirable since it requires to log off DB.

4. Try to improve indexes, optimize queries, reorganizing joins. Handle some of these at Application layer which can be prone to error/production issue.

5. Employ a caching layer. This creates consistency problem between updates in cache and database. (exacerablated in a cluster)

6. Denormalize data for faster access. But this vilated normalized forms definitions

=== Sharding and Share-Nothing Architecture

A possibe solution for horizontally scaling RDBMS is through *sharding* (partitioning but across machines/clusters)

For sharding, a shard structure is to be determined to spit the data:

1. Feature-based or functional segmentation

Segment data based on features that do not overlap with each other very much. Example, in e-commerce we can have table `users` in one shard and `items` in other shard. This approach requires a thorough understanding of the domain.

2. Key-based sharding

Find a key in your data to evenly distribute it across shards. Using some sort of one-way hash key on a key data element; and distribute data according to the hash.

3. Lookup table or directory based sharding

Use a look up table. ðŸš¨ Performance hit for lookup and lookup table becomes single point of failure.
