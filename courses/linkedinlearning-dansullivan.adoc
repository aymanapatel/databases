=== How SQL executes a Query


==== From declarative SQl to a procedural execution plan

- Modern SQL has some data types such as rollups and cubes that do not go intp row of RDBMSs

SQL takes declarative statements and create procedural **execution plans**; which are a set of steps that SCAN, FILTER and JOIN data.


==== Scanning tables and indexes

Use indexes to prevent high-cost FULL TABLE SCANS.Indexes pint to location of a row.


Types of indexes:

1. **B-Tree*: For equality and range queries
2. **Hash Indexes**: For equality
3. **Bitmap**: For set operations such as INTERSECTION and UNION.
4. Specialized indexes dor geo-spatioal or user-defined indexing straegies.



==== Joining tables


There are three types to join tables


|===

| Type| Description | Example

| Nested Loop Join |Compare all rows in both tables to each other

a|

- Loop through one tables
- For each row, loop thoigh other tawble
- At each step, compare keys
- [green]#simple to implement
- [red]#Higher cost#

|HashJoin| Calculate hash value of key and join based on matching hash values

a|

TODO


| Sort Merge join | Sort both tables annd then join rows while taking advantage of order

==== Partitioning data

- Storing table data in multiple sub-tables known as partitions
- Used to improve Query, Load and DELETE partitions
- Used for large tables- When subset of data is accessed or changed
- Can be expensive
- Partition key to be created for partitioning. (Can be date)



=== Materialized View


==== Refresh

Whenever you update row , you need to refresh materialized view so that you can see most latest changes.
